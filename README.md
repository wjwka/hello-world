# THIS IS JUST FOR FUN

I have a dream: to commit consecutively for one week, as long as it's green, the shade doesn't matter. 
Everybody loves to be greened, and will always forgive HER. Here comes clappings.

Today is 21/10/17, I have piles of deadlines this week, I wish I can survivie.
If I made it, I am gonna pamper myself with a long journey and will never forget the process which I thought at the first place would be really tough and frustraing is actually reachable and within my capabilities.

Recent moto is try it, do it, don't be fat.

Have fun and enjoy the life!
